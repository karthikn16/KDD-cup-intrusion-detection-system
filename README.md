network intrusion detection system



Due to the advance of information and communication techniques, sharing information through online has been increased. As a result, various online services were created. However, as increasing connection points to the internet, the threats of cyber security have also been increasing. IDS have nowadays become a necessary component of almost every security infrastructure. Intrusion detection plays an important role in ensuring information security, and the key technology is to accurately identify various attacks in the network. Analyzing network flows, logs, and system events has been used for intrusion detection. Network flows, logs, and system events, etc. generate big data. Big Data analytics can correlate multiple information sources into a coherent view, identify anomalies and suspicious activities, and finally achieve effective and efficient intrusion detection.
